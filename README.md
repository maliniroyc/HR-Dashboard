# HR-Dashboard
I designed an automated dashboard for the Human Resources department of a company using a structured dataset.

## Problem statement
XYZ company wanted a comprehensive overview of its workforce, including gender distribution across departments, to support better decision-making. To gain insights into employee activity status, salary allocation, termination trends, recruitment sources, and performance ratings, XYZ approached an HR analytics consultancy for data analysis.

I'm playing the HR analyst role in this project and rebuild a dashboard which can help the organization in taking data driven decision.


## Some major insights from the Dashboard

- **Employee Activity Status**
Out of 311 employees, only 67% are active, while 33% are terminated. This high termination rate may indicate retention challenges or restructuring trends that need deeper analysis.
- **Salary Allocation by Department**
The Production department consumes the largest share of salary budget (₹1.25 crore), followed by IT/IS. This suggests a workforce-heavy operational model and may warrant a review of cost-efficiency across departments.
- **Recruitment Source Effectiveness**
Indeed and LinkedIn are the top recruitment sources, contributing 87 and 76 hires respectively. This insight can help XYZ optimize recruitment spend and focus on high-yield channels.
- **Performance Distribution**
A mix of ratings—Fully Meets, Exceeds, Needs Improvement, and PIP—indicates performance variability. Targeted training or performance management strategies could help uplift underperforming segments.
- **Demographic and Satisfaction Trends**
With 57% female employees and varied satisfaction levels, XYZ can explore gender-based engagement strategies and address areas with low or very low satisfaction to improve morale and retention.
